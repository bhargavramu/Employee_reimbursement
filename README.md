Project Title: Expense Data Standardization & Reimbursement Analytics in Power BI

ðŸ”¹ Overview:
I recently worked on a Power BI project where I transformed and analyzed expense data to ensure data accuracy, consistency, and insightful reporting. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to provide meaningful insights into reimbursements and expenses.

âœ… Key Tasks & Solutions
ðŸ“Œ 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation in Power Query
ðŸ”¹ Corrected spelling and punctuation errors in the "Expense Type" column using Replace Values
ðŸ”¹ Standardized project names by applying Trim & Lowercase functions
ðŸ”¹ Handled missing currency values based on the amount:

Amount â‰¥ 1000 â†’ INR
Amount < 1000 â†’ USD
Else â†’ EURO
ðŸ”¹ Converted all expense amounts to INR using predefined exchange rates:

USD to INR = 83
EURO to INR = 87
ðŸ’¡ Tools Used: Power Query (M Language)

ðŸ“Œ 2. Data Modeling & DAX Measures
ðŸ”¹ Created a DAX measure to calculate the total reimbursed amount in INR:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Total_Reimbursed_INR = SUM('Table'[Amount in INR])
ðŸ”¹ Used CALCULATE to filter the total reimbursement for a specific project (Project_B):

DAX
Copy
Edit
Reimbursed_Project_B = 
CALCULATE(SUM('Table'[Amount in INR]), 'Table'[Project Name] = "Project_B")
ðŸ”¹ Created a DAX measure to count declined requests:

DAX
Copy
Edit
Count_Declined_Requests = 
COUNTROWS(FILTER('Table', 'Table'[Status] = "Declined"))
ðŸ’¡ Key Learning: Using DAX functions (SUM, CALCULATE, COUNTROWS, FILTER) to derive business insights efficiently.

ðŸ“Œ 3. Interactive Dashboard & Visualizations
ðŸ”¹ Slicer for dynamic filtering:

Project Name
Employee Name
ðŸ”¹ Column Chart: Employees vs. Reimbursement Amount
ðŸ”¹ Pie Chart: Project vs. Reimbursement Amount
ðŸ’¡ Outcome: Created an interactive and user-friendly dashboard that enables stakeholders to analyze reimbursements across projects and employees efficiently.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways & Learnings
âœ… Data Cleaning & Transformation: Ensuring accuracy in reporting
âœ… DAX Functions: Advanced calculations for insightful reporting
âœ… Data Visualization: Effective storytelling with Power BI
âœ… Interactive Reports: Slicers and dynamic visualizations for better decision-making

ðŸš€ This project enhanced my expertise in Power BI, Power Query, and DAX, making data-driven decision-making more accessible and efficient!
